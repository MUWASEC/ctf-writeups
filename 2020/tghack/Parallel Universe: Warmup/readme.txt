Can you create shellcode that runs on x86 and x86_64 simultaneously? Read the flag in flag.txt. The following syscalls are allowed:

    open
    read
    write
    close
    exit_group
    mmap

nc parallel.tghack.no 6005

or use a mirror closer to you:

    nc us.parallel.tghack.no 6005 (US)
    nc asia.parallel.tghack.no 6005 (Japan)

The binaries used on the remote side are provided for convenience:

    pwnme32
    pwnme64

Some clarifications:

    you have to use the same number of syscalls for both architectures
    they have to output the same amount of bytes
    you have to use the same syscalls for both architectures
