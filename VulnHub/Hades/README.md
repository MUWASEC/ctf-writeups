## The Infernal: Hades (v1.0.1)

#### Hades is a new boot2root challenge pitched at the advanced hobbyist. Solving this challenge will  
#### require skills in reverse engineering, sploit development and sound computer architecture
#### understanding. If you've never heard of an opaque predicate, you're going to have a hard time of it!
####  
#### I strongly suggest you don't start this the week before exams, important meetings, deadlines of any sort, marriages, etc.  
  
#### The aim of this challenge is for you to incrementally increase your access to the box until you can escalate to root. The /root/flag.txt  
#### contains, amongst other things, a public PGP key which you can use to demonstrate victory - the private key has been given to the `VulnHub.com`  
#### admins.  
 
#### Enjoy, Lok_Sigma
