You want to invade the fortress barad dur. You will got huge trouble, if youre noticed by some of the guards. You didn't hear this from me, but there's an unguarded entrance to the fortress. The way to that entrace is very dangerous, you have to evade the nazguls, they observe every time the area. The big eye is watching all time. If you reach the fortess, you have to go behind the fortress on the rocks. Go on, before i change my mind.
